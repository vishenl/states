Not through force or suppression, but by giving our brain and body exactly what it needs to shift naturally.</p><p>That question led to States - five carefully formulated compounds, each designed for a specific outcome. FOCUS for when you need clarity. ZEN for calm without drowsiness. BLISS for elevated mood and connection. DREAM for restorative sleep. And GAZM for deeper intimacy.</p><p>Working with Shawn Wells, one of the world's leading formulators with over 1,000 products and 40 patents to his name, we created something I believe is unprecedented: nootropics that actually work, backed by real clinical research, using patented ingredients at proper doses.</p><p>No proprietary blends hiding inadequate amounts. No cheap fillers. No compromise on quality.</p><p>I invite you to try States and experience the difference for yourself. I believe once you do, you'll understand why I'm so passionate about bringing this to the world.</p><p>To your optimal states,</p><p><strong>Vishen Lakhiani</strong><br>Founder, Mindvalley</p>",
